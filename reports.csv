NOTE: Effective July 1, 2014, the Mental Hygiene Administration and the Alcohol and Drug Abuse Administration were merged to create the Behavioral Health Administration within the Maryland Department of Health (MDH). Effective January 1, 2015, MDH implemented a new integrated Public Behavioral Health System. Certain functions previously performed by MHA are now performed by the Medical Care Programs Administration (MCPA). Specifically, MCPA now monitors and accounts for activities of the Administrative Service Organization (ASO) responsible for the authorization of behavioral health services, data collection, claims submission, and the payment of claims. Activities of the ASO since January 1, 2015 were excluded from this audit and are included in our audits of MCPA."
